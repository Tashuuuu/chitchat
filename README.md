# chitchat

Aims to be easy to setup for anyone interested in a privately hosted messenger-like service.
It's just about unusable in its current state, but feel free to contribute.

## Start developing
1. Golang if you don't have it (https://go.dev/doc/install)
   PS: OS package manager probably got a suitable version
2. Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. `go mod tidy` to install dependencies
5. `go run main.go` to start on port 3333

Nothing much works yet, but a lot of bootstrapping has been done.
